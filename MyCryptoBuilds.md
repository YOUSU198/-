MyCryptoBuilds is our automated build system. It allows you to preview any commit, pull request, branch, etc. It's especially useful for not having to wait to test a team member's work, or allowing non-developers to give feedback on designs and messaging. Basically, Mia is the best for setting this up.

There may be bugs, malicious code, or any number of things that could go wrong or steal your private keys and funds. Be especially careful sharing links externally and with non-developers who may not understand the risk. Thank you._

### Latest

- Build of the latest commithash on the `develop` branch

- https://mycryptobuilds.com/latest/

### By Commithash

- View build with a commithash at `https://mycryptobuilds.com/<commithash>`

- Example: https://mycryptobuilds.com/7445b0b3c5e6b672745b6a43f3d7dea91ae0c3dc/

- Protip: You can open a PR with a [WIP] preview, let the MyCryptoBuilds start running, grab the commithash, and then close the PR to test something quickly or on a computer that doesn't have your full dev enviro on it. 

### By Pull Request Number

- View builds based on a PR number rather than a commithash. Especially useful if wanting to test a PR with a stream of ongoing commits: `mycryptobuilds.com/pr/<number>`

- Example: `https://mycryptobuilds.com/pr/2453`


### By Branch Name 

- `mycryptobuilds.com/<branchname>`

- Example: `https://mycryptobuilds.com/develop`


### Build Logs
